Follow the instructions here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide and here https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LUKS_on_a_partition, making sure to follow commands in the correct sequence, which may be disjointed between pages (the encryption instructions should be explicit in which steps should be done before specific instrunctions in the former).
